# Hava81 Autonomous Progress

## 2026-08-28 04:00 checkpoint

- Built Day Plan, Hava81 Score, now-vs-later decisions and explainable reasons.
- Added six activity modes and local personalization.
- Upgraded city comparison to decision-oriented scoring.
- Added real UV/dust/pollen/marine context through server-side Open-Meteo integration.
- Added decision sharing, PWA service worker and opt-in decision alerts with quiet hours/deduplication.
- Added 81 static city entry pages and sitemap generation.
- Added transparent inter-city weather corridor feature.
- Main JS reduced from ~535 KB to 499.69 KB after lazy-loading secondary panels.
- Frontend regression: 78/78; API tests: 9/9; production audits: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Release pipeline is in progress; production v2.0 remains untouched until final canary gates pass.

## 2026-08-28 v2.1 release-candidate gate

- Canary API: port 4002, healthy, provider circuit closed, zero restarts.
- Real context smoke: Open-Meteo UV/dust/pollen plus İzmir marine data succeeded.
- Route corridor smoke: İstanbul → Ankara produced five weather segments and transparent non-navigation disclaimer.
- Decision calibration: 81/81 provinces and 486/486 activity plans passed; average Hava81 Score moved from 86 to 80 after calibration.
- Frontend: 78/78 unit/integration tests; line coverage 71.15%.
- API: 9/9 tests.
- Playwright: 7 active flows passed across mobile/tablet/desktop; 8 intentional project-specific skips.
- Lighthouse gate passed; most recent measured scores before commit were performance >90, accessibility 100, best practices >90, SEO 100.
- Frontend and API production dependency audits: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Main JS: 499.69 kB minified, below the configured 500 kB warning threshold.

## 2026-08-28 autonomous loop: first-load performance

- Production Lighthouse baseline on `/izmir`: performance 80, accessibility 100, best-practices 100, SEO 100; LCP 3.4 s and TBT 370 ms identified as the next highest-value issue.
- Removed eager `framer-motion` dependency from `App.tsx`; secondary Settings animation remains lazy-loaded.
- Main JS fell from 499.69 kB / 152.62 kB gzip to 373.75 kB / 112.07 kB gzip (~26% less main JavaScript).

## 2026-08-28 09:43 TRT run checkpoint

1. Notification reliability: stabilized same-day rain/difficult deduplication signatures and added regression coverage.
2. Route resilience/cost: added 1–2,000 km corridor guard before provider fan-out plus boundary tests.
3. Marine intelligence: added Open-Meteo wave direction/period to the API contract, backed by provider documentation and API tests.
4. SEO/deep links: rejected nested pseudo-city routes and added canonical-route regression coverage.
5. Panel testing: added ContextSignalsPanel attribution/marine rendering coverage.
6. Official warning integrity: researched MGM MeteoUyarı; deferred implementation because this run did not verify a stable official machine-readable feed with freshness semantics.

First local gate: 80 frontend tests passed, 9 API tests passed, type-check/lint/frontend+API builds passed, production dependency audit found 0 vulnerabilities. A second full gate follows before commit/deploy.
Second gate passed: 81/81 frontend tests, 10/10 API tests, type-check, lint, frontend/API builds, dependency audit (0 vulnerabilities), and Playwright smoke (7 passed, 8 intentionally project-skipped). Main JS remains ~373.78 kB minified / 112.07 kB gzip.

## Follow-up autonomous checkpoint

- Loop 1 alerts: added strong-wind and poor-AQI decision notifications with stable same-day dedupe and tests.
- Loop 2 model transparency: context panel now exposes fetch freshness plus modeled wave period/direction.
- Loop 3 route transparency: segment cards now show wind, a variable already used by the route score.
- Loop 4 SEO: root canonical/og:url added and city generator changed to replace them, preventing duplicate canonical metadata.
- Loop 5 operations: blue-green release checklist aligned to active 4002 / rollback 4001 topology.
- MGM MeteoUyarı remains intentionally deferred until a stable official machine-readable freshness-aware feed is verified.
- Quality gates after the five loops: 82/82 frontend tests, 10/10 API tests, frontend/API type-check + lint + builds, production dependency audit 0 vulnerabilities, SEO canonical assertions pass, Playwright 7/7 applicable smoke checks pass (8 intentional project skips).
- Browser false-negative diagnosed: a stale local docs HTTP server occupied Playwright port 4173; after removing the stale process, the real Vite preview passed all applicable browser flows. No product rollback was needed.
- API canary on 4001: readiness/live pass, OpenWeather circuit closed, CORS pass, 81/81 provinces current+forecast pass, Open-Meteo context returns attributed wave height/direction/period, route too-short guard returns 400.
- Production proxy intentionally remains on 4002 per current topology instruction; no traffic switch was made in this run.

- Loop 6 SEO/deep-link: production smoke exposed GitHub Pages 301 from slashless province paths to directory URLs. Canonical route generation, app history, sitemap and tests now consistently use trailing-slash province URLs.

## 2026-08-28 10:44 TRT run checkpoint

- Loop 1 data quality: next-24h Open-Meteo context maxima now exclude elapsed and beyond-window rows.
- Loop 2 API cost resilience: route weather has a stricter 12/minute endpoint budget before five-point fan-out.
- Loop 3 browser reliability: Playwright no longer reuses unrelated listeners on its preview port.
- Loop 4 CI/CD: superseded runs on the same PR/ref are cancelled automatically.
- Loop 5 PWA/SEO: İstanbul/Ankara shortcuts use the same trailing-slash route contract as GitHub Pages.
- Research: MGM remains the authoritative hazard source, but no stable official machine-readable feed was verified; Open-Meteo 15-minute precipitation outside supported high-resolution regions is interpolated and will not be labeled nowcast.

## 2026-08-28 morning cumulative summary (through 10:44 TRT)

- Completed improvement work across decision UX, route resilience, model transparency, alerts, canonical/deep-link SEO, performance, testing and CI reliability.
- Merged PR #4 after green CI; PR #5 also reached green CI and was merged.
- Quality baseline now includes 82 frontend tests and 10 API tests before this run's new data-quality test; prior browser gate passed all 7 applicable flows with 8 intentional project skips; dependency audits reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- API release validation: 4001 canary passed live/ready, CORS, route guards, Open-Meteo context and 81/81 province current+forecast checks. Public production remains deliberately on port 4002, preserving the requested topology.
- Notable decisions: official MGM hazards must remain explicitly attributed and freshness-aware; no scraping-derived pseudo-official warning layer; Open-Meteo 15-minute precipitation in Türkiye is interpolated and must not be called radar nowcast; modeled marine data is decision context, not navigation safety guidance.
- Remaining risks/priorities: verify a stable official MGM machine-readable warning feed; add favorite-city pollen thresholds only with documented source semantics; preserve 4002/4001 rollback topology; continue reducing first-load JS/LCP and expand panel/browser regression coverage.

## 2026-08-28 10:58 TRT polish checkpoint
- Started a dedicated visual-polish branch from synchronized `origin/main`.
- Added shared card elevation/radius tokens with dark-mode equivalents, stronger focus visibility for selects/textareas, and more legible skeleton states.
- Increased the visual hierarchy of city/current temperature, standardized Daily Plan and Activity surfaces, and corrected stale notification copy without changing weather/decision logic.

- 2026-08-28 polish-2: Started five UI polish loops for context freshness/source presentation, route weather scanability, mobile bottom navigation, settings selected states/dark mode, and decision-alert CTA surfaces. Awaiting validation gates.
- 2026-08-28 polish-2 validation: five presentation loops passed 82/82 frontend tests, lint, type-check, production build, Playwright 7/7 applicable flows, and production dependency audit with 0 vulnerabilities. Branch is pushed but intentionally not opened/merged against main until PR #7 CI completes. PR #7 remains blocked only by the GitHub-hosted Browser flows runner spending an unusually long time in `playwright install --with-deps chromium`; all other PR #7 jobs are green.

- 2026-08-28 polish-3: implemented five bounded loops: Forecast mobile scroll/surface polish, Environment Rail card coherence, Compare hierarchy, Search token/touch polish, and CI dist-artifact reuse. Validation pending full local gates. PR #9 production pipeline #59 confirmed success before starting this branch; live root/city/API ready were 200 and nginx remained on 4002.
- 2026-08-28 polish-4: while PR #10 CI ran, prepared an independent five-loop batch covering Settings mobile CSS dedup/safe-area, Weather Map token polish, blocked notification CTA behavior + regression test, and Activity Planner control affordances. Full gates pending.


## 2026-08-28 11:46 TRT performance checkpoint

- PR #11 reached green CI and was merged to `main` as `358f36f`; its production pipeline #63 is running while independent work continues.
- Performance loop: moved Forecast Atlas, Daily Plan and Environment Rail below the initial synchronous bundle boundary. They remain available through React Suspense and load independently; no weather or decision semantics changed.
- Main JS dropped from ~374.8 kB / 112.3 kB gzip on the prior build to 352.1 kB / 106.8 kB gzip (about 6% less minified main JS and 5% less gzip) while extracting their CSS from the main stylesheet as well.
- Full local gates passed: 83/83 frontend tests, lint, type-check, production build, dependency audit with 0 vulnerabilities, Playwright 7/7 applicable flows, Lighthouse assertions all processed successfully.
- Local Lighthouse after the split: performance 94, accessibility 100, best-practices 96, SEO 100; LCP 2.6 s and TBT 60 ms. This is materially better than the earlier production baseline of performance 80 / LCP 3.4 s / TBT 370 ms, though environments differ and production must be re-measured after deploy.
- Next queue: ship this split through PR/CI; then re-measure public production, inspect service-worker caching/versioning and static cache headers, and add browser coverage for lazy forecast rendering if needed.
## 2026-08-28 11:51 TRT parallel font checkpoint
- While PR #12 CI runs, prepared an independent branch from stable `main` to remove an avoidable font-subset fetch.
- Normalized the modeled dust/pollen micro unit for display from Greek small mu (`μ`, U+03BC) to the SI micro sign (`µ`, U+00B5), including provider-returned units. This preserves the visible unit while avoiding activation of IBM Plex Sans's Greek subset solely for that glyph.
- Validation: lint, type-check, 83/83 frontend tests and production build pass. Local Lighthouse reached performance 95 / accessibility 100 / best-practices 96 / SEO 100 and its network trace contained only IBM Plex Latin + Latin Extended fonts; the ~19.5 kB Greek font request disappeared.
- This branch remains independent and will be rebased onto `main` only after PR #12 is green/merged.

## 2026-08-28 11:55 TRT parallel settings checkpoint

- While PR #13 validates, prepared a second independent branch from stable `main`: removed `framer-motion`, which was used only by the lazy Settings drawer.
- Replaced the drawer/backdrop entry animation with lightweight CSS keyframes and an explicit `prefers-reduced-motion` opt-out. Focus trapping, inert background behavior, Escape handling and all settings interactions remain in React.
- Settings lazy chunk fell from ~132.5 kB / 42.5 kB gzip to ~7.3 kB / 1.9 kB gzip, and the runtime dependency was removed from package manifests.
- Validation on the independent branch: lint, type-check, 83/83 frontend tests, production build, dependency audit 0 vulnerabilities and Playwright 7/7 applicable flows all pass.
- Hold this branch until PR #13 is green/merged, then rebase and run combined gates before opening its PR.

## 2026-08-28 cache/lazy-render checkpoint
- Live header measurement: GitHub Pages returns `max-age=600` for HTML, hashed JS and `sw.js`; this is a hosting constraint rather than an app-controlled header.
- Hardened service-worker registration to bypass HTTP cache during update checks and added browser coverage that delays the ForecastAtlas chunk while confirming the decision-first city view remains usable and the lazy forecast renders afterward.
- Validation: lint, type-check, 83/83 frontend tests, production audit 0 vulnerabilities, production build, Playwright 8/8 applicable flows and Lighthouse assertions all passed.

## 2026-08-28 share/growth checkpoint
- Improved decision sharing to include the localized now-vs-later recommendation, avoid duplicate native-share URLs, keep canonical links in clipboard text, and avoid false share analytics when no share transport exists.
- Validation: lint, type-check, 83/83 frontend tests, production audit 0 vulnerabilities, production build and Playwright 7/7 applicable flows passed.

## 2026-08-28 SEO/social-preview checkpoint
- Added complete root Open Graph/Twitter preview metadata using the stable Hava81 mark, converted 81-city generation to replace city title/description/URL metadata, and added build-time single-tag assertions to prevent duplicate canonical/social fields.
- Validation: lint, type-check, 84/84 frontend tests, production audit 0 vulnerabilities, production build, Playwright 7/7 applicable flows, generated city metadata assertions and Lighthouse assertions passed.

- Public `/istanbul/` Lighthouse checkpoint after PR #12/#13/#16: performance 89, accessibility 100, best-practices 100, SEO 100; FCP 1.9 s, LCP 3.5 s, TBT 100 ms, CLS 0.028. TBT improved strongly from the earlier 370 ms baseline while LCP remains data-bound; added API DNS-prefetch/preconnect to the prepared SEO branch for the next deploy measurement.

## 2026-08-28 deploy-race recovery checkpoint
- A live Lighthouse run briefly hit `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` while GitHub Pages was serving a new deployment; an immediate browser probe was healthy, indicating an asset-version/cache race rather than persistent application failure.
- Added one-shot `vite:preloadError` recovery with cache-busting navigation and clean-URL restoration, plus a Playwright regression that forces the first ForecastAtlas chunk request to 404 and requires the app to recover without a fatal screen. Validation pending.

## 2026-08-28 12:40 TRT — CI runtime maintenance
- GitHub-hosted jobs now warn that Node.js 20-backed JavaScript actions are deprecated and will be removed from runners on 16 September 2026. Updated checkout/setup-node plus artifact upload/download actions from v4 to their current v6 majors so Hava81 CI runs on the supported Node 24 action runtime.

## 2026-08-28 map-CSS split checkpoint
- Lighthouse identified the main stylesheet as render-blocking while WeatherMap is already lazy. Moved Leaflet framework CSS from the app entrypoint into the lazy WeatherMap module so map styles load only with the map. Validation pending.

## 2026-08-28 early-current bootstrap checkpoint
- Prepared generated-HTML bootstrap for the first current-weather request: it runs before the Vite app module, respects saved TR/EN language, skips users with a matching fresh 5-minute weather cache, and exposes one promise consumed by weatherService. Added unit coverage for consume/fallback and browser coverage requiring exactly one current-weather request.
- Validation complete: type-check, lint, 86/86 frontend tests, production audit 0 vulnerabilities, production build, Lighthouse assertions, generated bootstrap-before-module checks, and Playwright 10/10 applicable flows passed. Fresh cache produced 0 current requests; cold city load produced exactly 1.
- Reliability follow-up: bounded early-bootstrap network wait to 10 seconds; unresolved/failed bootstrap now falls back to the normal BFF client rather than waiting indefinitely.

## 2026-08-28 13:13 TRT — branding regression checkpoint

- Visual QA caught a user-visible React scaffold favicon in browser tabs. The root cause was broader than the tab: `favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, and `logo512.png` were still the original React/CRA cyan assets even though `hava81-mark.svg` had already been introduced.
- Re-rendered the Hava81 atlas mark into 512px/192px PNG assets and multi-size ICOs, added a dedicated 180px Apple touch icon, and changed browser icon URLs to versioned Hava81-specific paths so aggressively cached React favicons are not reused.
- The same correction also fixes PWA install icons and the PNG used by Open Graph/Twitter social previews.
- Added browser regression coverage that verifies the favicon/touch-icon URLs, image dimensions, and the Hava81 amber center sample so the scaffold branding cannot silently return.
- Validation after the asset change: lint and TypeScript pass, 86/86 frontend tests pass, production build plus all 81 generated city pages carry the corrected icon links, full Playwright previously passed 12 applicable flows, and the updated branding-specific desktop Playwright check passes.

## 2026-08-28 13:21 TRT — air-quality trust correction

- Production DOM audit found OpenWeather AQI `3/5` rendered as `Hassas Gruplar İçin Sağlıksız`, which incorrectly mixed OpenWeather's documented 1–5 qualitative scale with a US AQI health category.
- Aligned both API and web labels to the provider scale: `Good / Fair / Moderate / Poor / Very Poor` and `İyi / Makul / Orta / Kötü / Çok kötü`.
- Centralized the frontend 1–5 mapping and made invalid/non-integer indices render unavailable rather than clamping them into a fabricated category.
- Added frontend coverage for the visible `3/5 · Orta` production case plus utility coverage for all five levels and invalid values; API tests now verify level 3 in both English and Turkish.
- Validation: frontend lint/type-check pass, 88/88 frontend tests pass, API type-check and 7/7 API tests pass, frontend production build + 81 city generation pass, API production TypeScript build passes.

## 2026-08-28 13:24 TRT — mobile touch-target audit

- A production 390 px DOM audit measured eight interactive controls below Hava81's 44 px touch-target rule: the daily-plan share action, the activity sensitivity select, and six activity chips were all 40 px tall.
- Raised those controls to a 44 px minimum without widening the layout or changing content hierarchy.
- Added a mobile Playwright regression that scans all visible buttons, links, form controls and button-role elements and fails if either rendered dimension is below 44 px.
- Validation: production build + 81 generated city pages pass and the new 390 px touch-target browser check reports zero undersized controls.
## 2026-08-28 13:27 TRT — scaffold residue cleanup

- Searched the tracked source tree for React/CRA/Vite starter branding after the favicon regression and found one remaining original CRA React logo at `src/logo.svg`; it had no runtime imports and was deleted.
- Updated the API package identity from the pre-Hava81 `@weather-dashboard/api` / “Turkey Weather Dashboard” metadata to `@hava81/api` / Hava81 wording, including its lockfile identity.
- Updated the product roadmap so the already-completed CRA-to-Vite migration is no longer described as future work. The explicitly historical `docs/QUALITY_BASELINE.md` CRA references remain untouched because they document the before-state rather than current product identity.
## 2026-08-28 13:31 TRT — sharing surface upgrade

- Replaced the generic square app-icon social preview with a dedicated 1200×630 Hava81 share card that communicates the product promise without inventing weather data.
- Upgraded Open Graph metadata to publish the PNG type and 1200×630 dimensions and switched Twitter/X metadata from a small summary card to `summary_large_image`, including accessible image alt text.
- The generated city-page pipeline inherits the same share surface; verified all 82 generated HTML entry pages (root + 81 cities) point to the large Hava81 card.
- Extended the existing browser brand regression to decode the social image and verify its dimensions alongside favicon/install assets.
- Validation: browser-suite lint passes, production build and 81-city generation pass, all 82 generated HTML entry pages carry the expected metadata, and the targeted desktop branding browser test passes.

## 2026-08-28 13:50 TRT — service-worker cache reliability

- Audited the production nginx template and found `/sw.js` was accidentally captured by the generic `.js` rule, giving the service worker a one-year immutable cache lifetime.
- Added an exact-match `/sw.js` location with `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` while preserving one-year immutable caching for ordinary static assets.
- Validated the updated nginx configuration inside the project’s nginx runtime image with `nginx -t` successfully.
