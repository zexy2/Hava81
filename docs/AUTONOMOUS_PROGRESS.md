# Hava81 Autonomous Progress

## 2026-08-28 04:00 checkpoint

- Built Day Plan, Hava81 Score, now-vs-later decisions and explainable reasons.
- Added six activity modes and local personalization.
- Upgraded city comparison to decision-oriented scoring.
- Added real UV/dust/pollen/marine context through server-side Open-Meteo integration.
- Added decision sharing, PWA service worker and opt-in decision alerts with quiet hours/deduplication.
- Added 81 static city entry pages and sitemap generation.
- Added transparent inter-city weather corridor feature.
- Main JS reduced from ~535 KB to 499.69 KB after lazy-loading secondary panels.
- Frontend regression: 78/78; API tests: 9/9; production audits: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Release pipeline is in progress; production v2.0 remains untouched until final canary gates pass.

## 2026-08-28 v2.1 release-candidate gate

- Canary API: port 4002, healthy, provider circuit closed, zero restarts.
- Real context smoke: Open-Meteo UV/dust/pollen plus İzmir marine data succeeded.
- Route corridor smoke: İstanbul → Ankara produced five weather segments and transparent non-navigation disclaimer.
- Decision calibration: 81/81 provinces and 486/486 activity plans passed; average Hava81 Score moved from 86 to 80 after calibration.
- Frontend: 78/78 unit/integration tests; line coverage 71.15%.
- API: 9/9 tests.
- Playwright: 7 active flows passed across mobile/tablet/desktop; 8 intentional project-specific skips.
- Lighthouse gate passed; most recent measured scores before commit were performance >90, accessibility 100, best practices >90, SEO 100.
- Frontend and API production dependency audits: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Main JS: 499.69 kB minified, below the configured 500 kB warning threshold.

## 2026-08-28 autonomous loop: first-load performance

- Production Lighthouse baseline on `/izmir`: performance 80, accessibility 100, best-practices 100, SEO 100; LCP 3.4 s and TBT 370 ms identified as the next highest-value issue.
- Removed eager `framer-motion` dependency from `App.tsx`; secondary Settings animation remains lazy-loaded.
- Main JS fell from 499.69 kB / 152.62 kB gzip to 373.75 kB / 112.07 kB gzip (~26% less main JavaScript).

## 2026-08-28 09:43 TRT run checkpoint

1. Notification reliability: stabilized same-day rain/difficult deduplication signatures and added regression coverage.
2. Route resilience/cost: added 1–2,000 km corridor guard before provider fan-out plus boundary tests.
3. Marine intelligence: added Open-Meteo wave direction/period to the API contract, backed by provider documentation and API tests.
4. SEO/deep links: rejected nested pseudo-city routes and added canonical-route regression coverage.
5. Panel testing: added ContextSignalsPanel attribution/marine rendering coverage.
6. Official warning integrity: researched MGM MeteoUyarı; deferred implementation because this run did not verify a stable official machine-readable feed with freshness semantics.

First local gate: 80 frontend tests passed, 9 API tests passed, type-check/lint/frontend+API builds passed, production dependency audit found 0 vulnerabilities. A second full gate follows before commit/deploy.
Second gate passed: 81/81 frontend tests, 10/10 API tests, type-check, lint, frontend/API builds, dependency audit (0 vulnerabilities), and Playwright smoke (7 passed, 8 intentionally project-skipped). Main JS remains ~373.78 kB minified / 112.07 kB gzip.

## Follow-up autonomous checkpoint

- Loop 1 alerts: added strong-wind and poor-AQI decision notifications with stable same-day dedupe and tests.
- Loop 2 model transparency: context panel now exposes fetch freshness plus modeled wave period/direction.
- Loop 3 route transparency: segment cards now show wind, a variable already used by the route score.
- Loop 4 SEO: root canonical/og:url added and city generator changed to replace them, preventing duplicate canonical metadata.
- Loop 5 operations: blue-green release checklist aligned to active 4002 / rollback 4001 topology.
- MGM MeteoUyarı remains intentionally deferred until a stable official machine-readable freshness-aware feed is verified.
- Quality gates after the five loops: 82/82 frontend tests, 10/10 API tests, frontend/API type-check + lint + builds, production dependency audit 0 vulnerabilities, SEO canonical assertions pass, Playwright 7/7 applicable smoke checks pass (8 intentional project skips).
- Browser false-negative diagnosed: a stale local docs HTTP server occupied Playwright port 4173; after removing the stale process, the real Vite preview passed all applicable browser flows. No product rollback was needed.
- API canary on 4001: readiness/live pass, OpenWeather circuit closed, CORS pass, 81/81 provinces current+forecast pass, Open-Meteo context returns attributed wave height/direction/period, route too-short guard returns 400.
- Production proxy intentionally remains on 4002 per current topology instruction; no traffic switch was made in this run.

- Loop 6 SEO/deep-link: production smoke exposed GitHub Pages 301 from slashless province paths to directory URLs. Canonical route generation, app history, sitemap and tests now consistently use trailing-slash province URLs.

## 2026-08-28 10:44 TRT run checkpoint

- Loop 1 data quality: next-24h Open-Meteo context maxima now exclude elapsed and beyond-window rows.
- Loop 2 API cost resilience: route weather has a stricter 12/minute endpoint budget before five-point fan-out.
- Loop 3 browser reliability: Playwright no longer reuses unrelated listeners on its preview port.
- Loop 4 CI/CD: superseded runs on the same PR/ref are cancelled automatically.
- Loop 5 PWA/SEO: İstanbul/Ankara shortcuts use the same trailing-slash route contract as GitHub Pages.
- Research: MGM remains the authoritative hazard source, but no stable official machine-readable feed was verified; Open-Meteo 15-minute precipitation outside supported high-resolution regions is interpolated and will not be labeled nowcast.

## 2026-08-28 morning cumulative summary (through 10:44 TRT)

- Completed improvement work across decision UX, route resilience, model transparency, alerts, canonical/deep-link SEO, performance, testing and CI reliability.
- Merged PR #4 after green CI; PR #5 also reached green CI and was merged.
- Quality baseline now includes 82 frontend tests and 10 API tests before this run's new data-quality test; prior browser gate passed all 7 applicable flows with 8 intentional project skips; dependency audits reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- API release validation: 4001 canary passed live/ready, CORS, route guards, Open-Meteo context and 81/81 province current+forecast checks. Public production remains deliberately on port 4002, preserving the requested topology.
- Notable decisions: official MGM hazards must remain explicitly attributed and freshness-aware; no scraping-derived pseudo-official warning layer; Open-Meteo 15-minute precipitation in Türkiye is interpolated and must not be called radar nowcast; modeled marine data is decision context, not navigation safety guidance.
- Remaining risks/priorities: verify a stable official MGM machine-readable warning feed; add favorite-city pollen thresholds only with documented source semantics; preserve 4002/4001 rollback topology; continue reducing first-load JS/LCP and expand panel/browser regression coverage.

## 2026-08-28 10:58 TRT polish checkpoint
- Started a dedicated visual-polish branch from synchronized `origin/main`.
- Added shared card elevation/radius tokens with dark-mode equivalents, stronger focus visibility for selects/textareas, and more legible skeleton states.
- Increased the visual hierarchy of city/current temperature, standardized Daily Plan and Activity surfaces, and corrected stale notification copy without changing weather/decision logic.

- 2026-08-28 polish-2: Started five UI polish loops for context freshness/source presentation, route weather scanability, mobile bottom navigation, settings selected states/dark mode, and decision-alert CTA surfaces. Awaiting validation gates.
- 2026-08-28 polish-2 validation: five presentation loops passed 82/82 frontend tests, lint, type-check, production build, Playwright 7/7 applicable flows, and production dependency audit with 0 vulnerabilities. Branch is pushed but intentionally not opened/merged against main until PR #7 CI completes. PR #7 remains blocked only by the GitHub-hosted Browser flows runner spending an unusually long time in `playwright install --with-deps chromium`; all other PR #7 jobs are green.

- 2026-08-28 polish-3: implemented five bounded loops: Forecast mobile scroll/surface polish, Environment Rail card coherence, Compare hierarchy, Search token/touch polish, and CI dist-artifact reuse. Validation pending full local gates. PR #9 production pipeline #59 confirmed success before starting this branch; live root/city/API ready were 200 and nginx remained on 4002.
- 2026-08-28 polish-4: while PR #10 CI ran, prepared an independent five-loop batch covering Settings mobile CSS dedup/safe-area, Weather Map token polish, blocked notification CTA behavior + regression test, and Activity Planner control affordances. Full gates pending.


## 2026-08-28 11:46 TRT performance checkpoint

- PR #11 reached green CI and was merged to `main` as `358f36f`; its production pipeline #63 is running while independent work continues.
- Performance loop: moved Forecast Atlas, Daily Plan and Environment Rail below the initial synchronous bundle boundary. They remain available through React Suspense and load independently; no weather or decision semantics changed.
- Main JS dropped from ~374.8 kB / 112.3 kB gzip on the prior build to 352.1 kB / 106.8 kB gzip (about 6% less minified main JS and 5% less gzip) while extracting their CSS from the main stylesheet as well.
- Full local gates passed: 83/83 frontend tests, lint, type-check, production build, dependency audit with 0 vulnerabilities, Playwright 7/7 applicable flows, Lighthouse assertions all processed successfully.
- Local Lighthouse after the split: performance 94, accessibility 100, best-practices 96, SEO 100; LCP 2.6 s and TBT 60 ms. This is materially better than the earlier production baseline of performance 80 / LCP 3.4 s / TBT 370 ms, though environments differ and production must be re-measured after deploy.
- Next queue: ship this split through PR/CI; then re-measure public production, inspect service-worker caching/versioning and static cache headers, and add browser coverage for lazy forecast rendering if needed.


## 2026-08-28 12:02 TRT reliability / operations checkpoint

- Production after PR #12: root, `/istanbul/` and API `/api/v1/health/ready` all return 200; OpenWeather circuit is closed. Public main JS transfer fell from 112,154 bytes to 106,785 bytes (resource size 374,825 -> 352,106 bytes). A single production Lighthouse run scored performance 81 / accessibility 100 / best-practices 100 / SEO 100 with LCP 3.8 s and TBT 0 ms; production Lighthouse remains noisy, so bundle transfer size is the reliable measured improvement.
- Server disk hit 100% during a test/commit. Diagnosed 3.8 GiB systemd journal history plus Docker build cache and package caches. Safely vacuumed archived journals to ~536 MiB, pruned unused Docker build cache, cleaned package cache, and restored ~5.8 GiB free space. Added `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/hava81-storage.conf` with `SystemMaxUse=512M` and `SystemKeepFree=2G`; journald restarted healthy.
- MGM research refreshed against official pages: MeteoUYARI is confirmed as MGM's two-day color-coded official warning presentation, but no stable documented machine-readable freshness-aware feed was found. Integration remains deferred rather than scraping the presentation pages.
- Parallel reliability loop: bounded the frontend in-memory GET response cache to 200 entries, prunes expired entries and evicts the oldest entry only when inserting beyond the cap. Added a 205-unique-request regression test. Targeted lint/type-check/cache tests and production build pass; full gates will run after prerequisite performance PRs merge.
